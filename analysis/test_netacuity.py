# This script uses processed ping responses from round t-1 and round t to calculate the number of dropouts, responsive, and antidropout addresses per round
# Conceptually, at the beginning of a round t, there are N (say 1000) addresses that responded in round t-1 and can potentially dropout this round. Let's suppose there are D dropouts (say 100), then 900 of them continued to respond in this round as well (NOTE: the way erosprober works, if an address hasn't dropped out, then it *must* be responsive since all addresses are pinged each round). However, it is possible that some addresses dropped out due to reassignment so M *other* addresses (say 50) lit up. Then the total number of outages is D - M.
